The SmartRouting project was started in 2023 by [Thomas
Jakobi](https://github.com/jako) as rewrite of the popular XRouting extra for
MODX. 

Unfortunately, this extra has not been updated in the MODX repository since 2015
and many unfixed issues have arisen since then, including the lack of full PHP 8
compatibility.

Many thanks to all who contributed to XRouting and SmartRouting, whether by
creating pull requests, submitting bug reports, or donating.
